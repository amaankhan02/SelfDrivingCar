data has only been annotated for month of november data (last ones starting with 1511...)
	but new data was got for HAAR cascade data, and was annotated for haar cascade. So get those xml files and move them here

AND, the folder of images was changed, so in every xml there is a field for filepath, you must CHANGE THIS
